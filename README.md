# SeedLeech Transfer Platform
seedleech is a full-featured transfer platform aiming at simpleness. You can
bascially send or receive any file as long as you have one entry point.

## About
seedleech consists in three parts:
- **The Client**: a nicely configured Transmission torrent client and curl can
replace it, so why bother ?
- **The Seedbox**: exact same thing as the client. Still, there will be one.
- **The Tracker**: this is where all the intelligence is.


## Deployment procedure
The deployment procedure is not here yet.
